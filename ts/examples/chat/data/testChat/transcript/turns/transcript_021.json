    "value": " So, I studied psychology, and I studied zoology. And I kind of came out of university yet somewhat disillusioned by both. The – there were things I – basically, there were things I wanted to learn, and they were not the things the courses were necessarily teaching.  \n \nSo, I was very interested in animal behavior. And there were some really interesting psychology lectures on that, but very few of them. And at the time, the – the dominant paradigm for animal behavior was based on the work of a chap called Skinner. And it was very much animals are kind of robots, and they didn’t think, and they don’t have emotions, which is obviously a very convenient thing to think if you’re then going to run experiments on them.  \n \nAnd in zoology, I very much wanted to learn about insects and arachnids, and all the things I was interested in. And we got precisely one lecture on that, and it was how to kill them, which was not really what I felt I’d signed up for.  \n \nSo, I sort of – I came out of out of university with a fairly, fairly dismal degree, and no real interest in pushing that sort of academic side of things further. Whereupon I ended up, through a series of bizarre chances, with a career in law, mostly because I got a job as a legal secretary, because my writing had given me a high typing speed. And it basically comes down to that, something as ridiculous as that, then just kind of paid the rent for the next 10 years or so until the, well, 10-15 years or so until the writing finally took off. \n ",
