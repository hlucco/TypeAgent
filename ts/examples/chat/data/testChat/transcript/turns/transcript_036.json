But the crows themselves refuse the notion that they’re sentient. And so, you know, there’s this human interpretation that the human characters in the book want to project onto them that they reject.  \n \nAnd I thought that was a really interesting thing, because, you know, it’s a little bit what’s, I think, happening right now with some of these generative AI systems, like ChatGPT, that it can seem very much like a person, but it very much isn’t. Like, it’s a – you know, the mechanism of it is very simple. Like, it’s just a very complicated machine for predicting what the next thing in a sequence of tokens is going to be.  \n \nAnd so, I wonder if you’ve… I mean, you’ve probably been asked this a lot. But, you know, what do you think about the parallels between the Corvids and the… you know, these generative AI systems? \n ",
