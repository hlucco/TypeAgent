    "value": " Yeah. So, I think now, I don’t know whether you feel this way, but, like, I read a lot of fiction and a lot of science fiction, and I think you have one of the most distinctive voices in science fiction right now. And, like, there are a number of things that I think you do incredibly well. Maybe the most interesting one is creating these extremely alien or non-human characters with a, you know, just sort of a rich tapestry and social structure, psychology around them.  \n \nSometimes, it looks like you’re even trying to choose these characters in a way where they are initially off putting. And, you know, through your storytelling, you often get to the point where these very non-human characters seem more human than the humans themselves, which I think is a really, you know, just sort of a fascinating thing.  \n \nHow did you get to that voice, because I’m guessing that’s the thing that every author struggles to find, is, like, how do I not just, you know, replicate? And, like, maybe even some of this is related to the, you know, the generative AI conversation we’re about to have, which is, you know, these systems, remix a bunch of stuff that already exists. It’s unclear whether the current generation of the systems can – could actually materialize an authentic, genuine, interesting new voice and point of view to tell a story from. Like, I don’t see any evidence of that happening yet. So, how did you get there? \n ",
