    "value": " Literally just writing more stuff. Writing and reading. I mean, I can there’s definitely a period when the stuff that I’m writing is cleaving quite closely to the authors that I’m reading, and I’m picking up very valuable stuff, just from reading other people’s work, and incorporating it into my own.  \n \nSo, I think, you know, writing itself is the best way of improving your writing. Reading other people’s work, who, you know, people who are writing at a higher level, effectively, than you are, is always good.  \n \nIf you are able to take criticism, which is frankly not a gift I had at the time, then there are various other ways you can go. There are writing courses, there are writers’ groups. If you’re able to have someone kind of tear your work apart a bit in the interest of making it better, there are certainly shortcuts, I think, to polishing up your style. But when you are an aspiring writer, it can be extremely hard to take that criticism in the spirit that it’s meant. \n ",
