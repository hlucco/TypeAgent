    "value": " I think – I mean, I think that’s probably why the book works as well as it does, because I mean, and especially why the book works for people who would normally be quite averse to spiders, as an enormous number of people are. But once you have… once you’re seeing the spiders from inside, I think a lot of that arachnophobia, a lot of the arachnophobia triggers go away, and you begin to empathize with the characters, because even though they’re non-human, they are often having to overcome recognizably human problems. \n \nThey have aggressive neighbors; they have plagues and disease. They have sort of social justice issues, effectively. And although those are sort of socially specific to the spider, they’re still recognizable to us. And at that point, you are… they’ve crossed that barrier between us and them. They become a person to the reader.  \n \nWhereas I think if they were presented, say, like, the – the bugs in Starship Troopers, say, where you’re seeing them first from the human eyes, and you’re seeing them as a kind of a menace and something that’s alien, and ugly, and just generally there to be destroyed, I think it’d be very hard to come back from that by trying to take you into their point of view later on.  \n \nSo, it’s almost like a – kind of a – a guerrilla assault, really, of just getting in past people’s defenses by showing them in their own company and through their own eyes. \n ",
