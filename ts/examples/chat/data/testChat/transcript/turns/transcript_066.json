    "value": " Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I know a lot about the context of this particular episode. And it’s really interesting. Again, you know, the mechanism of these systems at the moment is, like, really quite simple. And so, what happened there is basically, Kevin Roose, the reporter, you know, was trying to get the system to – I mean, basically, to see what the system will say under a whole bunch of different circumstances. And it was this very long conversation where, you know, he talked about everything from Jungian shadows to, like, try to get the thing to reveal details about its meta prompt, you know.  \n \nAnd you know, it’s sort of… the way that the system works is that each step, you have the prompt that you’ve given it and the context so far, and it’s trying to predict what’s next. And you can walk down these hallucinatory paths, where all of the things that are next are just sort of equiprobable, and like, the probabilities are all small. And so, like, there’s nothing good that comes next. Like, it’s all just weirdness, and it sort of picks randomly, like, one of the weird paths.  \n \nAnd then, because it’s interacting with a human, you’re like, oh, this is very strange. Like, I want to punch into this some more. And it just gets weirder and weirder, where the probabilities get smaller and smaller, and like, you’ve got this broader and broader set of things that are, you know, as far as it’s concerned, are, like, equally okay to respond with.  \n \nAnd so, like, the – you know, it’s very easy when you’re interacting with this to feel like you’re interacting with something that’s a human. Like, the mechanism, like, it’s really just rolling dice, you know, and, you know, it’s like, it’s almost like a Dungeons and Dragons game. It’s like, roll one D20 and, like, it tells you to leave your wife, you know, if you hit a 19. (Laughter.) And it’s a very interesting place that we’re at right now, you know, just in terms of seeing how people are interacting with these systems.  \n \nAnd, like, the way that we sort of fixed it is, like, there’s a meta prompt that instructs the model. You know, here are your rules of engagement when you are interacting with someone in this context. And, like, this particular context is search, but you might have other contexts which are, like, a coding assistant or whatever.  \n \nAnd so, we did two things to fix that particular issue. We said, you can’t have long conversations with the – you know, with the bot, like the number of turns are now limited, which means you’re less likely to get into a hallucinatory path and get stuck. And, like, we changed a couple of lines of the meta prompt to tell it not to be aggressive in, like, very specific ways.  \n \nAnd so, like, part of the interesting thing for us is just figuring out how to condition the systems where they behave in ways that their users will feel comfortable with. Like, A, they have to do something useful. Otherwise, there’s no point in doing any of this at all. And, like, B, the useful thing that they do has to, like, be a thing that you’re comfortable with and that you want. So, you know, it’s sort of an interesting engineering challenge. \n \nBut it’s also, you know, interesting, to your point, to think about, like, in science fiction, you’ve got this full spectrum of, you know, Butlerian Jihad to, you know, Iain Banks, you know, post-scarcity Culture society, like, that feature AIs. Like, one is, you know, like cannot coexist at all with humans. Like, you have to sort of eliminate or throttle down the capabilities of these systems, because, like, there’s just no way that the authors can imagine coexistence. And then there’s, you know, Iain Banks, where they’re sort of the foundation of, like, this post-scarcity society that he’s imagined.  \n \nMy hope is, as one of the people participating in the development of things, is, like, we get a little bit more agency than I think sometimes people give us credit for, for choosing which of those two ends of the spectrum we are steering towards. (Laughter.) \n ",
