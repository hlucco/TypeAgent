    "value": " That’s true, but all right, counterpoint. The thing that the current chat – I mean, my personal – my current standpoint on the current programs are there is literally nothing there beyond that input/output mechanism. There is no core of selfhood, there is no self-awareness. There is nothing that can know what it is doing. And that is one reason why people, for example, using it as a diagnostic tool or as a research tool is such a terrible, terrible idea, because it has no idea whether it is right. It is simply giving you an answer that looks like the sort of answer it feels it should be giving. And even saying “feels it should be giving” is anthropomorphizing it far more than is actually there.  \n \nBut because this is specifically the purpose we have built them for, they are very good at feigning acting like a person. They’re very good at having an apparent personality, even, and certainly, you could almost certainly skew particular chatbots to be, to give you different outputs not merely in the sort of content they were giving you, but in the apparent personality of the entity giving you it. That will be active – that will be quite – I don’t think it’s being done, but I think it’d be quite easy to do. \n \nSo, let’s say you had, for each of these robot-controlled Formula 1 cars, you added in one of these programs and gave it a particular personality. And this one was punchy, and this one was sort of trash talking its opponent. And this one was the, you know, the new program that had never ridden a race before and was very much the underdog. You – I mean, you could do a whole kind of WWF, or it would be – it would be WWF meets Cars, basically, wouldn’t it? You could have this, and people would get enormously invested in these completely artificial sort of fake personalities, because that’s what we do.  \n \nThe whole thing that we’re doing with chatbots now is what people were doing with the – the Eliza program decades and decades ago, which is if a thing talks to you in any kind of human-like way, in the same way we see faces in the clouds, we will see a personality there. It’s the same reason I suspect that human history is so full of personifications of the weather or of places or of ideas, is because it is really easy for us to put a human personality on a thing that has nothing there.  \n ",
