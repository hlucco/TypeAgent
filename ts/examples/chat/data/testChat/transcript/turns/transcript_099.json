    "value": " A thing that we all lost our minds on, you know, investing in. And, you know, we will sort of run into some kind of brick wall and, like, and people will lose interest. I think it’s going to be the former, not the latter. Like, at least in my experience, like, I’ve got a decent nose for the, you know, the paradigm shifting things and, like, crypto never made sense to me, whereas, like, AI, I’ve spent 20 years investing an enormous amount of energy in. \n \nSo, yeah, it’s going to be interesting, the next few years. And I think, you know, the fun thing for me about authors like Adrian is, like, I read him because, like, he actually doesn’t write dystopian fiction. Like, I’m pessimistic enough in my day job where what I need in my fiction is some optimism. \n ",
