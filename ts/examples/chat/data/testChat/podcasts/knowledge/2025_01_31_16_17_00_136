I had this relatively narrow set of things that I just wanted to know everything possible to know about the things. And so, it was super easy, you know, like, you were just – you threw anything into that funnel and it was going to get digested. And then I had things that I wasn’t interested in, and if you couldn’t very clearly explain to me why the concept you were teaching me mattered, like what reason do I have for internalizing this? Like, I would just completely ignore it, you know. And so, like, I was super contrary about like, chemistry, for instance, which I wish I hadn’t been. But like, I do think it’s really interesting to me, like, even watching my kids, like they learn differently than I learn. And so, like, figuring out how to adapt your teaching style to like this, you know, real diversity of learning styles that people have is it just seems hard."}]},"sourceIds":["2025_01_31_16_17_00_136"]},{"value":{"verbs":["say"],"verbTense":"past","subjectEntityName":"KEVIN SCOTT","objectEntityName":"none","indirectObjectEntityName":"SAL KHAN"},"sourceIds":["2025_01_31_16_17_00_136"]},{"value":{"verbs":["say"],"verbTense":"past","subjectEntityName":"KEVIN SCOTT","objectEntityName":"none","indirectObjectEntityName":"CHRISTINA WARREN"},"sourceIds":["2025_01_31_16_17_00_136"]}],"sourceEntityName":"KEVIN SCOTT"}
