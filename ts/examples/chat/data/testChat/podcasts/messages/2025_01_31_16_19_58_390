And, you know, they were kind of like the founders of the field, to some degree, of AI. So I actually sought him out, and he was my freshman advisor. And he taught the class, you know, Intro to Artificial Intelligence. \\n\\nSo that was definitely that was a pretty big draw, but I was also really drawn to these ideas of, you know, that first summer after my freshman year, I got an internship at the Media Lab to kind of create, like an image processing library, which at the time, I thought was like, the coolest thing in the world. Obviously, we take all of this stuff for granted now. Our phones can, you know, edit images way better than anything we could have done back in 1995. But, you know, both of those were really interesting to me.\"}}"
