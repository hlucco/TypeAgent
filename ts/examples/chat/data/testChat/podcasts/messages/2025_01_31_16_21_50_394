And once again, you know, B-School is not famous, especially HBS isn’t known for being particularly quantitative. And capital markets was known as the most quantitative class that they had there. \\nAnd I did become a little bit of a closer in that class, where the professor, who actually had a similar background, he – you know, his undergraduate was in engineering. He was a former engineer, and then he went and got a PhD in business. I remember his name, Professor George Chacko. \\nAnd I remember one day after class, I went and I said, you know, Professor Chacko, I love this class. Like, what should I do with my life that does this? And he said, oh, you should work at a hedge fund. And I said, oh, that sounds good; what’s a hedge fund? He explained it to me and a little bit was the financial. You know, I had another set of whatever, 100 and something thousand dollars of debt coming out of business school, on top of the $40 or $50,000 of debt of undergrad. And I learned that one could make decent money at a hedge fund. So I said, okay, I’m going to work at a hedge fund. \\n\\nAnd then it was a horrible job market. This was, you know, 2003. And I probably got rejected 40 or 50 times by different – I had no background. My resume looked good to be a product manager at a tech company. My resume looked good to maybe even be a tech VC. My resume did not look good to be a hedge fund analyst. \\nBut eventually this one guy, Dan Wohl, who was starting, he was just creating his fund. He was just one guy. He actually liked my resume because I had no background in finance. He was a little bit of a contrarian that, you know, he thinks the best investors are not thinking like all the other investors. So he gave me a shot.\"}}"
