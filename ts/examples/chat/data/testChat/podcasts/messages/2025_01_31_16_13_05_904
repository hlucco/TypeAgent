I remember when I first heard about Khan Academy and, you know, I was kind of – I think I was probably kind of skeptical about the idea, right? Like, okay, well, how good could this be? And then you, you know, looked at the content and started to meet people who worked there and who were instructors and also meet people who learned things from it. \\nAnd just from my own perspective, this was before I even moved into tech, I was so impressed, as you said, because A) the ambition is huge, but I think B) even more importantly, it’s one of those rare cases where you see something that has really achieved a lot of what it set out to achieve and in providing access to everyone. \\nAnd it’s great that the situation that you had when you were a kid is not the case for kids today, right, that because of technology and access and because of people like Sal, more of that is available than ever. So I’m really looking forward to this conversation between the two of you.\"}}"
