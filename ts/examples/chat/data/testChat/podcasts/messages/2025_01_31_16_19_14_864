I was one of those kids, like I want to understand the big questions. You know, what is the nature of reality? \\nAnd I’m still interested in those big questions, but once I got there, you know, this was ‘94 that I started my freshman year, obviously computers were already a thing. I’d luckily – when I was in high school, I took some dual enrollment courses at the University of New Orleans. And there was a professor, Dr. Santanilla, this was the summer before I went to MIT, he saw that my family, we couldn’t afford a computer. And I was interested in computing. And so, he gave me a research fellowship, essentially so I could get access to his computers. He actually paid me a little bit, too. But that’s the first time that I really had full access to, like, good, like, powerful computers. And I taught, you know, some more powerful programming techniques, etcetera. \\nAnd so, by the time I got to college, I started to get really enamored with, well, instead of, you know, being a theoretical physicist and all of what that entails, what if I could – there were two areas of computing that were really interesting to me at the time, you know, this notion that you could create a reality versus just study a reality, and the idea of, you know, this very – perhaps even a bigger question than the nature of reality is the nature of consciousness or intelligence. And obviously, that’s becoming a very big question even more so these days. But I got really interested in artificial intelligence back then.\"}}"
