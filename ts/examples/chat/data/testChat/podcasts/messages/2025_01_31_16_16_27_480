Who knows how good I may or may not have been. But if you think about it, I think to become a really good tutor, and it’s a little bit different if you’re running a large class versus tutoring, but there’s really two skills ideally that you have, and they’re somewhat orthogonal. And that’s maybe why some – you know, you don’t see maybe them happening in combination a lot. \\nOne is I think it’s super important that you know the subject matter, like, you know, forwards and backwards, that you’re excited about it, that you have a conceptually deep understanding. \\nAnd then the other one is that you have a good sense of modeling what’s going on in the other person’s mind. It’s called almost like a intellectual empathy, I guess you could call it. And those are two different things. \\nAnd you know, I think especially when you go into some math topics, you oftentimes might – well, you know, sometimes there are people who are really good at one, like they’re really good at the pedagogy and the modeling and the empathy, but they don’t have, to your point, like a PhD level of the understanding of the math, etcetera, etcetera.\\nAnd so, there’s only so far they could go in like saying why this is cool or how it connects to other things, or why this formula is really just a repackaging of this other formula. \\nSo I think, you know, for just random flukes of I was the kid growing up, I’m sure you were too, that when a formula was given, you’re like, well, why does that make sense? Let me prove it to myself.\"}}"
