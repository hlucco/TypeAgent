And so, I said, well, I can create something that generates problems for my cousins, and a way for me to keep track of them so I can see how they’re doing. So I created that. That was the first Khan Academy.\\nAnd it’s funny because after the – my experience at a startup in the late ‘90s, I had convinced myself, talk about talk tracks, that I am not an entrepreneur. I do not have the emotional fortitude to be an entrepreneur, especially a tech entrepreneur. \\nAnd when I was building the software, a lot of my friends, especially my friends from business school, they’d come to me and say, why are you working on this? How are you going to monetize this? What’s the business model? \\nAnd I didn’t even want to answer their questions. I was like, nope, this is a family passion project. This is just a fun, little piece of software that I’m making. Stop asking me questions about the business model. Stop being such a cynic!\\nAnd then one of the friends said, well, this is cool, but how are you scaling your lessons? I said, I’m not. He said, why don’t you make them as YouTube videos? I said, that’s a dumb idea. YouTube’s for dogs on skateboards, cats playing piano. But I gave it a shot and my cousins famously told me they liked me better on YouTube than in person. So I kept going. And they liked the pause, the repeat. You know, I think hopefully they like me in person, but, you know, coaching them and mentoring them. But they liked the on-demand version. \\nAnd so, I kept going, and still psychologically, I’m saying this is just my hobby. My day job is the hedge fund; I enjoyed it. This is my hobby. One day, I might start a school or something, and maybe that school could leverage this software that I’m making for my family. But I started. The more that I started getting feedback from my family, and then the more that other people started using it, discovering it on YouTube, or discovering the software, I naturally did say, well, maybe, maybe this could be for millions of people one day, billions of people one day. \\nAnd if you fast forward to 2008, that’s when I incorporated Khan Academy and I set it up as a nonprofit. And part of it was almost just to protect it from what I had seen, like the excesses of the dot-com boom and even my own mental. I was like, you know, this is a project that is – I don’t care whether – how much money I make, as long as I can keep doing this thing. \\nAnd I was thinking about all the people who were using it and getting value from it, and that they wouldn’t have gotten value from it if I at some point tried to monetize them or do a freemium offering or something like that. Or at least that’s how I thought about it. And so, yeah, I set it up nonprofit, mission: free world-class education for anyone, anywhere. \\nAnd there’s an irony here. In business school, the only class that I think I would have failed if they had grades was a class called Social Entrepreneurship, where I was super cynical about it. I was just like, you know, most of these nonprofits, it’s more about PR. You know, I remember writing that, a whole essay about some, you know, bike ride that, you know, was to cure some disease. And I’m like, is this really going to cure the disease? And I didn’t realize that the professor had actually created that nonprofit. So anyway, that –\"}}"
