It just takes a while to get an idea fully baked and to, like, make your first version of your product and to launch it and to learn from it and get, you know, things into a state where they can be like a really scalable product. And like, you spent a while on the runway like, you know, in sort of harsh conditions. Like, I think it’s like really, really amazing and commendable. \\n\\nSo, you know, once you had more resources, because I think the really extraordinary thing about Khan Academy is like, how effective you all have been at getting leverage, like, you know, using the assets that you had access to, to like, very effectively get more learning into the hands of more learners.\\nAnd like, I do want to actually get to AI here in a minute, but, you know, 2010 is sort of, you know, well, well, well pre-Generative AI or even the beginnings of the deep learning boom that, you know, sort of happened in 2012 or so. \\nSo like what were you using those resources to help scale back then?\"}}"
