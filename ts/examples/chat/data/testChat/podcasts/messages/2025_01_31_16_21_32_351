They would grade you, but they’d kind of tell you what you would have gotten, but everyone essentially will graduate. \\nAnd, you know, I used to joke that MIT’s motto was “mens et manus,” which means hand and mind or mind and hand. And I used to joke that Harvard Business School’s motto should be mind and mouth, because – and I say that actually in a nice way, because the whole – everything is case based. They’re like religious about case based. So it’s all about talking. It’s all about you show up and for three hours that day you’re just talking to each other.\\nAnd you know, coming from a more like intellectually, let’s call it hardcore engineering environment, I’m like, oh, what is this? This is easy. \\n\\nBut once I left there, I realized how much a lot of that stuck with me, that I remember a lot more of those conversations than I do – I can’t even tell you all the courses I took in undergrad, much less what was in them, but I remember a lot of conversations. Even now in, you know, my job at Khan Academy, I – there’s a moment, and I’m like, oh, this is just like that one case I saw 20 years ago.\\nSo I thought it was a great experience. And I like the way they did it. It was you know, I call it high school done right. Like, especially at HBS, it was everyone had assigned seats, it had mandatory attendance. There was actually even a little bit of an implicit dress code. Like, you don’t dress like a typical college or grad student. You had to, like, show up and, you know, dress decently. The professors all wore, you know, suit and tie. \\nLike it was – there’s something about it that I kind of enjoyed. And it forces you to build a community. It forces you to interact with people that would have been otherwise different than you. \\nYou know, I met and became very close friends with people who are very different than me, people who were, you know, Navy Seals. I did not know any Navy Seals. Now, I was becoming good friends with Navy Seals or, you know, people who are – you know, there was a gentleman in my section who was a Catholic priest. He ended up marrying performing the ceremony for my wife and I. I think it’s the first time in world history that a Catholic priest married, you know, a Shia and Sunni, at least nominally. \\nBut, you know, it’s just that exposure and you know, being able to talk through a lot of scenarios was I actually thought it was a very – I really enjoyed the experience.\"}}"
