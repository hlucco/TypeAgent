So I think one of the common things that I see or have seen with the students that I’ve taught over the years, and like the same is true with engineers, and I see it with my children, is it’s very easy to believe that when you encounter something hard where you’re not immediately good at the thing or you don’t immediately, you know, just get it, that you can tell yourself a story that, oh, I’m bad at this thing. And it’s usually nonsense. \\nLike, I saw it with my oldest daughter. Like, she, for reasons I just don’t even understand, like the child is super bright, when she was in the fifth or sixth grade, she had, like, convinced herself that she wasn’t good at math. And like, clearly it was incorrect. I mean, it was hard, because like, she was in advanced math classes and it was difficult and like, she had other things that she took that didn’t seem as difficult to her, like that she learned more quickly. \\nAnd now she’s like, you know, two years ahead of grade level in advanced math, and like just super excited about it, and like, math is her favorite subject, math and, you know, chemistry.\\nPart of that is like her just overcoming this story that she was telling herself that like, hey, I’m not good at this and like, you know, flipping the narrative in her head. Like, I don’t know, like how often you encounter this in the students that you teach.\"}}"
