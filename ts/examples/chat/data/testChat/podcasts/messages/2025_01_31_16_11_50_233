Let’s make it so our AI doesn’t cheat, so that we can support students in, say, writing an essay, making the student do the work, but acting as an ethical writing coach. And if the student goes to ChatGPT or someplace else to get their essay written for them and brings it into our system, then our system, when it talks to the teacher, is going to say, well, you know, Kevin and I didn’t work on this essay together. And by the way, it’s not consistent with his other writing. We should double-click on whether Kevin really did this work. So I actually think the AI can actually be used to undermine AI cheating itself.\"}}"
