And if I’m honest, I probably looked kind of relaxed from the outside, but by the time junior, senior year came around, I was pretty angsty around this. Like, what am I going to do with my life? \\nAnd on one side, there was definitely a financial consideration. You know, my mom, I remember filling out her taxes the year before I went to college to get financial aid, and she made like $16,000 a year. You know, she was essentially working, like, pretty, you know, hourly, you know, manager at a convenience store or cashier type of job. So I was like, it’d be pretty irresponsible for me to, like, not help the family in some way. \\nAnd, you know, but I did say, well, maybe I want to do a PhD, but I wasn’t personally I used to tell people, if there was like a PhD in everything, that’s the one I would want to do. Because, you realize that – or if there was one that was more focused on maybe education and less focused on – not education in the sense of you can get obviously a PhD in education, but one more focused on the learning of computer science or the learning of mathematics in particular, that could have been interesting.\\nBut I was – and people will tell you, I thought I was going to be pre-law for a little bit. I thought I was going to go to med school for a little bit. I was an MCAT instructor for the Princeton Review in 1997. Like, I had no idea what I was going to do. \\nAnd then I thought I was just going to stick around and get my masters. They had this like five-year program where you can just do another year. And this was 1997, ‘98, my senior year, and I learned of a few people who graduated the previous year who came out to Silicon Valley and, you know, were getting paid $70, $75,000 a year, which back then seemed like a ton, and which it actually was pretty good back then, in the late ‘90s. And I was like, wow, that’s like five times what my mom is making. Maybe I should do that. \\n\\nSo I accelerated. I was like, oh, I could just jam some more courses in, in the next two terms, finish the masters, and then I applied out of cycle, and I ended up, you know, moving out to Silicon Valley to be a product manager at Oracle.\"}}"
