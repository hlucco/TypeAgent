{"speaker":"CHRISTINA WARREN","speech":{"value":" No, I think you nailed it. I was going to say curiosity, right, like having an awareness, having a curiosity and being willing to do that, I think you nailed it. And that can unlock so many things for so many different types of people, but especially for kids, especially – or for anyone who’s learning. Let’s not even limit it to kids, right? I think anyone who’s wanting to learn anything, being able to kind of unlock that, and to your point, yeah, not have to be afraid, oh, will I be made fun of, am I asking this in a weird way, am I being annoying, I don’t understand this enough, you know, do I – or, you know, what time in the world is it? Do I have someone who I can ask these things to, right? It’s great to have access to that, and that can unlock other things. Okay, well, now that I know this, well, what about this other thing? And what could these two things do together? Unlocking curiosity, I think, is one of the – that’s why people learn, right, is why people are continuing to go through that process. And anything we can do to lower those barriers, I think is great. \nAnd obviously, I think that aligns so super well with the work that the Khan Academy is doing and is going to continue to do. And I’m grateful that people like Sal, you know, did all the work that he did and shifted his mindset to saying, okay, is there a better way and is there a more accessible way to start giving access to more people, you know, more content and more learning resources. And here we are, you know, like you said, almost 20 years later, and it’s really fantastic to see.
