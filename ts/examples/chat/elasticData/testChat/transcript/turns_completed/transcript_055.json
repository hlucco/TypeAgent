Even if the money raised from that bike ride really isn’t going to cure the disease, it does build awareness for the disease so I’m much less of a cynic now than I used to be, but it’s an irony that I am now a nonprofit founder. That’s my life. \nBut and starting a nonprofit, just talking about starting a business, it’s starting a nonprofit in any space is actually harder in many cases. If I wanted to be for-profit, I was living out in Silicon Valley at that point, there were VCs that were already coming to me as like, oh, I found your stuff pretty good. You know, I’ll write a check right now; you can go start the business. It was tempting. There was no model, really, for a tech focused nonprofit. In fact, the few foundations I would talk to really didn’t understand it well. \nBut anyway, I took the plunge in 2009, quit my day job because I frankly couldn’t focus on anything else and tried to see if we could get at least some philanthropic support to get off the ground.","type":1,"sourceIds":["./elasticData/testChat/transcript.txt"]},"listeners":["KEVIN SCOTT","CHRISTINA WARREN"]}
