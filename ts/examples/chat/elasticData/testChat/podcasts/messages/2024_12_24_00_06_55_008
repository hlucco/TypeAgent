Even going back to those high school tutoring sessions, that really helped. And so the idea is, could we use technology to scale up that type of personalization and mastery learning? I didn’t have that word in my vocabulary at the time, but that’s what we were doing, mastery learning, which was coined by Benjamin Bloom in 1984. It really is this notion of if you haven’t learned something well yet, especially if it’s something foundational, you should have the opportunity and the incentive to learn it well. It’s that simple. And that’s what a tutor can do. If you’re a teacher with a class of 30, it’s very hard, if Kevin has a gap, to stop the whole class to teach Kevin. \\nSo the whole True North of Khan Academy has always been and continues to be, our mission is free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere. The free, anyone, anywhere part, that speaks to scale, that speaks to low cost, you know, low marginal cost. \\nBut then we – I intentionally, or at least subconsciously intentionally put that world class in there. I did not want that to be a tradeoff between low cost and scale and world class. And what does world class look like? Well, it’s personalized. It meets you where you are. You know, I write in my book, Brave New Words, like Aristotle was the tutor of Alexander. That’s what world class looks like; you have Aristotle as your tutor. And so the idea was always, could you approximate that and scale it and make the marginal cost close to zero, so that you can give it hopefully away for free?\\nAnd we did that with videos and exercises and even early forms of AI with things like recommendations and teacher tools. We think teachers are a very important part of this ideally. Some places kids don’t have teachers, so we still want to support them, but ideally the teacher is very involved in this.\\nBut then obviously when we first saw, especially, you know, this is summer of 2022, OpenAI reaches out to us and shows us, you know, this is probably around the same time that you saw it. We were probably one of the few people in the, you know, world to see that level of generative AI, to see GPT-4 months before even ChatGPT existed. I was like, wow, this could get us that much further to this ideal of scalable world class.\"}}"
