I’ve been using it with my kids. I’ve been using it myself. There’s this guy, Sal Khan. His wife let him quit his job. He creates these great videos.” And I was like, what? Like Bill Gates is like, not only using it, he’s actively using it. He’s like a super user of this. He knows who I am. And that, I remember showing that video to my wife, and I was like, is this happening? Like, what do I do? Do I call him? How do I call him? Like, what’s the protocol here? \\nAnd then it was two weeks later. Larry, who’s you know, runs Bill’s office called, and you know, I was about to record a video. I see it’s a Seattle number, like, hello, and it’s like, “Oh, this is Larry, Larry Cohen. I work with Bill gates. You might have heard that he’s a fan.” I’m like, yeah, I heard that. You know, we’d love to fly you up in the next few weeks if you have a chance, to learn how we might work together. And I was looking at my calendar for the month, and it was completely blank. And I said, yeah, you know, I think I can make time to fly up and meet with Bill. \\nAnd, you know, we had – obviously, you could imagine, it was an ultra-surreal experience for me. But that obviously, just the fact that a very serious person like Bill took this seriously and found value in it was a shot in the arm. \\nAnd then obviously it was both the Gates Foundation and Google in the fall of 2010 that each gave on the order of about $2 million each over a two-year period to, you know, allow us to become a real organization.\"}}"
