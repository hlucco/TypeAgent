And if your intent is to be evil, you will find ways to make the technology evil. If your intent is to be lazy, you’ll find ways that technology can empower your laziness. But if you want to learn, or if you want to help people learn, there’s always ways that technology can be valuable. You know, the same video technology that might, you know, have people watch not so great stuff, we can also use to teach them. And so, it’s all about how do you mitigate the harms and maximize the benefits. \\nAnd I tell everyone who is a well-intentioned person, just checking out and running the other way, that just means only the bad folks or the lazy folks are going to be using technology, especially now with these very powerful technologies like generative AI. \\nAnd so, it’s obvious things like teaching – cheating, and then, you know, there’s issues sometimes with AI potentially around maybe bias, errors, hallucinations. What if students want to use it for unproductive ends, they want to, you know, help making a bomb or something like that or they want to harm themselves. \\nSo what I told our team at Khan Academy is like, look, those aren’t reasons not to work with Generative AI. Those are reasons to just put guardrails around it and turn those into features. Let’s make it so the teacher can see what the students are doing if they’re under 18. Let’s make it so our AI doesn’t cheat, but it can Socratically nudge you in the right direction. \\nLet’s make it so that we can support students in, say, writing an essay, making the student do the work, but acting as an ethical writing coach. And if the student goes to ChatGPT or someplace else to get their essay written for them and brings it into our system, then our system, when it talks to the teacher, is going to say, well, you know, Kevin and I didn’t work on this essay together. And by the way, it’s not consistent with his other writing. We should double-click on whether Kevin really did this work. So I actually think the AI can actually be used to undermine AI cheating itself. \\n\\nSo any tool can be used for good or for bad. And so, that’s kind of like the big theme of the book. Here’s all of the ways that it can be used well, here’s all of the fears and risks that people have, but here’s how we should mitigate those and actually turn them into benefits.\"}}"
