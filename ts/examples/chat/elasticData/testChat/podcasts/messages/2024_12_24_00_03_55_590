I tutor her remotely. That starts to work out. \\nAs I often joke, I became a tiger cousin. I called up her school. I really think Nadia should be able to retake that placement exam that was putting her into a slower math track. They let her take it. She was then able to place into an advanced math track. I was hooked, I started tutoring her younger brothers. Word spreads in my family, free tutoring is going on. Before I know it, I’m tutoring 10, 15 cousins, family, friends. \\nAnd I was enjoying this, you know? And once again, this wasn’t the first time we talked about me tutoring in high school and etcetera. But having a background in tech, and I think, you know, I’m sure you do this all the time, you’re always like, okay, I think I’m adding value now. If only there were ways to scale or automate parts of this.\"}}"
