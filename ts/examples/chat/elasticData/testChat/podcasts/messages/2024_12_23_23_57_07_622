So, like, this is super, super interesting to me. So when I was a PhD student, I taught computer science to college kids. So I was the TA for, you know, University of Virginia’s sophomore computer science course. Like, I taught a graduate seminar, and, like, I was an instructor at the University of Göttingen in Germany, and, like, taught a couple of classes there. \\n\\nTeaching is really hard, like really, really difficult. And I think, you know, folks in engineering and science, like we don’t always do a great job preparing teachers for teaching, you know, those materials.\\nAnd part of what makes it hard is like it’s really different teaching, you know, like a super, highly motivated, super well prepared A student versus, you know, a C student. And like, it’s not because one is smarter than the other. It’s like, it’s just a different bag of tools that you have to go deploy to, like, get someone to learn the way they need to learn.\\nLike, how on God’s earth did – and, you know, sometimes, like the harder thing is like not teaching the A student; it’s teaching the C student. So how did you figure this out when you were a high school student? Like that seems extraordinary.\"}}"
