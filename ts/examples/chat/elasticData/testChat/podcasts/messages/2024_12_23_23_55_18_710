The earliest memory I have, you know, I was always I liked Legos and I liked building stuff, and I had a fascination with transformers and cars and drawing robots all day. I remember even when I was very young, I used to, you know, in the ‘80s, they called us latchkey kids. You know, my mom would be at work and my sister and I would come on the school bus and, you know, we just watched the afternoon cartoons, and I remember just having stacks of pieces of paper, and I would draw some combination of bridges, cities, cars and robots. So maybe that was an early – I used to like to draw though, too. \\nAnd then I remember when I was seven, my uncle doesn’t remember this, but he was very young at the time, and we were living with them, and he was doing some math. And I said, oh, what is this? And he says, oh, this is calculus. \\nAnd I’m like, oh could you teach it to me? And he says, no, no, you know, you’re only seven, you know, blah, blah, blah. I’m like, oh, it looks interesting. What do you need this for? \\nI remember this conversation clear. I remember it was like right in his bedroom. And he said, oh, well, you know, I want to be an engineer and this is really important. And I said, well, what do we engineers do? And he said, well, you know, everything around you an engineer had a influence on or built it and designed it. And I said, well, then I want to be an engineer. \\nAnd then – he doesn’t remember any of this. And he said, well, if you want to be an engineer, you should go to MIT. He just said that randomly in like, whatever, 1983 to me. I had no idea what it stood for, where it was. But I remember that’s when it got into my head that that’s where I wanted to go to school.\"}}"
