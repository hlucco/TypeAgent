You know, a year ago, you went to HBS, you were working at a hedge fund. There’s a certain energy you get from people where they’re interested in you in certain ways. \\nAll of a sudden, you’re some guy making YouTube videos. And this was well before, you know, anyone knew about people making money on YouTube or any kind of celebrity of being on YouTube. And now you’re popular if you’re doing something on YouTube. But the – back then – and you’re a husband and you’re a father, and people look at you like you are an irresponsible person. I was telling myself, like, what have I done? \\nYou know, and as I mentioned, I grew up with not a lot of resources. So, like, one of my things, I never wanted to be in this situation, especially my family, to be in the situation that we are, you know, we had to deal with the scarcity that I had to deal with when I was a kid. \\nBut the only thing that kept me going, frankly, was, you know, my wife and I, we looked at our finances, okay, I can do this for maybe a year, max. And maybe I could go back if they’ll take me. But I would also get these letters from people all over the world saying how it helped them. And that’s the thing, I was like, well, this thing is scaling. There’s people who are getting real benefit from it. \\nAnd then it was about 10 months in that I started to get, I would say, like, real – and we got some national publicity. So that was a shot in the arm. It was, ironically, about the financial crisis, because I’d made a bunch of videos about credit default swaps and mortgage backed securities. So they started putting me on national television to explain these things. \\nBut it was in May of 2010 that we got our first real donation. It was $10,000 from Ann and John Doerr, a name some folks might recognize. And I had lunch with Ann, and she was shocked to find out that that was the largest donation. She was like, how are you supporting your family? And I was like, I’m not. \\nAnd then when I went home, I remember her texting me, you know, you really should support your family. I’ve just wired you $100,000. And so, that was a huge – you know, obviously the money mattered. I could start paying myself a small salary, but the real, you know, Ann and John, you know, they are serious people who wouldn’t just write a check willy-nilly. So that was a shot in the arm. \\n\\nAnd then you know, connecting it to your world, a couple of months later, I ran a little summer camp just because I was all – I never thought online learning is a replacement for physical; I always thought it was a complement. So I was running a physical, in-person summer camp. I was doing a stock market simulation with a bunch of middle schoolers. And I get text messages from Ann, which you can imagine I now take very seriously. And she wrote, “I’m at the Aspen Ideas Festival in the main pavilion, Bill Gates being interviewed by Walter Isaacson, Bill Gates talking about Khan Academy last five minutes.” \\nAnd I’m like, what is this? And I boot the nearest seventh grader off of a computer. I actually was able to find the footage of Walter Isaacson interviewing Bill gates. Walter just randomly asks, “Bill, what are you excited about?” Open question. And Bill says – and people can look up that video, Aspen Ideas Festival, Bill Gates, Khan Academy, you know, you’ll find it.\"}}"
