I think you’re right, it is kind of the perfect, you know, paying it forward gift, right, and I think it’s a reminder, I think, for all of us not to immediately kind of diminish or dismiss, you know, a kid’s earnestness or anyone’s earnestness, but also to, you know, it’s not too hard for you to understand. I think that’s especially important, as we do move into, you know, new worlds with AI, to – to borrow the, the pun from his book.\\nSpeaking about AI, which was part of the conversation towards the end of your conversation, one of the things that I was really impressed with about what he said was about how when we look at the power of these tools, and obviously there’s a lot of concerns, and many of them are valid – and we need to be careful about how things are being used. But the fact is that throughout history, you know, these tools have accrued the most benefit for people who have the deepest skill sets. \\n\\nAnd him saying that I think is a way to reinforce the importance of learning basics and learning fundamentals and that, yes, just because we can do things faster and maybe we can do things at another level, doesn’t mean that we don’t need those other skills, too. \\nI thought that was really, really profound, and I think a really good way of framing how this is not an either/or situation. This is something where the people who – I’ve seen this myself just in the last couple of years with Generative AI, where genuinely the people who get the most out of it are the people who are already very good at what the tool is being used for. \\nAnd – but I really like that frame, and I really liked thinking about thinking this isn’t a replacement. If anything, this is more of an opportunity for why you need those fundamentals and to get people excited about learning to begin with.\"}}"
