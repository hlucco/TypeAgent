Yeah, I think the motivation one is definitely a big one. And I think especially with parent-child dynamics, there’s all sorts of baggage that gets involved there.\\nBut generally speaking, yes, for that student that you kind of described as like the C student, there’s usually – and Nadia was in that category in 2004. There is a lot more foundation of rebuilding someone’s confidence. \\nI fundamentally think the reason why most people say, why do I have to learn this, this doesn’t matter to me, it’s really to protect their self-esteem. It’s usually because there’s something a little bit frustrating about that subject matter, and they’re saying, well, I don’t need to learn this anyway. \\nBut, you know, like, you know, many of us, I used to enjoy playing basketball when I was in P.E., but I never said, why am I putting an orange ball through a hoop 10 foot in the air? You know, I’m a five-foot-nine Indian kid. I don’t see a lot of kids like me in the NBA. But I was interested because I could engage, even though I was, you know, usually the last or second to last person to be picked. So I think the same thing is true in most – in most topics, like, you know, kids disengage to protect their self-esteem.\"}}"
